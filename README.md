pongo
=====

My attempt to implement pong.

Based on this great project tutorial: [https://earthly.dev/blog/pongo/](https://earthly.dev/blog/pongo/)

I'm extending the project to support networked play.

Usage
-----

As you're actively developing the game, you can compile and play it with this command:

```sh
go run .
```
